\details{
This dataset was created from original GSS 2004 data for illustrative
purposes such that (1) it is small and (2) contains just enough variation in
respondent's personal networks to illustrate various functions in the
package. It is essentially a stratified sample from original data (1472
cases). Strata correspond to groups of cases created from unique combinations
of values on the following ego variables: \code{age} (3 categories), \code{race},
\code{sex}, \code{marital}, \code{numgiven}. At most 2 cases were sampled from each stratum
via simple random sampling with replacement.
